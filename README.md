### Key Features:
1. **Drag-and-Drop Control Pad Creation**  
   Design your control pads by dragging and dropping components like buttons, sliders, switches, Joystick and D-PAD.  

2. **Multi-Protocol Support and Seamless Server Connections**  
Easily configure your control pad to support network protocols such as **Bluetooth LE, WebSocket, MQTT, TCP, and UDP**. Once connected, you can interact with the control pad’s components—including **buttons, sliders, switches, joysticks, and D-PADs**—to send real-time commands directly to the connected server or BLE client, where these commands can be processed.

3. **Switch Connection Type Anytime**  
   You can change the connection type of a control pad at any time without creating a duplicate for a different connection.
   
## Supported Components
1. Switch
2. Button
3. Slider
4. DPAD
5. Joystick
6. Steering Wheel
7. Accelerometer and Gyroscope (If supported by the device)

## How It Works (4 steps) 

### **Step 1: Create a Control Pad**  
Start by creating a new control pad. Provide a unique name to identify your control pad.

   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0bb34e6-d2ab-4245-ada9-19a8a030ebdc" width="240" height="426" />
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2ff23e0-cf4c-4c97-820f-69ec1efa935b" width="240" height="426" />

### **Step 2: Design Your Control Pad**  
After creating the control pad, click on the **Build** icon and use the drag-and-drop interface to add components like switches, buttons, and sliders etc.
   
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d501e0db-1c4e-426c-b71c-506b6ab497c5" width="240" height="426" />

Assign a unique **ID** to each component. This ID will be sent to the server during interactions.

### **Step 3: Configure Connection Settings**  
Tap **'Settings**, choose a connection type (TCP, Bluetooth LE, UDP, WebSocket, or MQTT), enter the server address and port. You can switch between connection types anytime

### **Step 4: Connect and Interact**  
a. Click on the **Play** icon to start interacting with your control pad.  
b. Tap the **Connect** button in the bottom-right corner to establish a connection with the server.

## **Reading Interactions**  
When users interact with the control pad, JSON-formatted or CSV messages are generated based on the type of component used. 
These string messages enable receivers to understand and process interactions sent from the control pad. Below are the formats and details for each interaction:  

---

### **Switch**  
Toggling a switch generates the following JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "SWITCH",
  "state": true
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, toggling a switch generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,SWITCH,<state>`.

- The `state` field indicates whether the switch is **on** (`true`) or **off** (`false`).  

---

### **Button**  
Pressing or releasing a button generates this JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "BUTTON",
  "state": "PRESS"
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, pressing or releasing a button generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,BUTTON,<state>`.

- The `state` field can have following values:  
  - **"PRESS"**: When the button is being pressed (finger on the button).  
  - **"RELEASE"**: When the button is released (finger lifted off after pressing).
  - **"CLICK"**: Indicates tap gesture   

---

### **DPAD (Directional Pad)**  
Pressing or releasing a button on DPAD generates this JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "DPAD",
  "button": "RIGHT",
  "state": "CLICK"
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, pressing or releasing a button on DPAD generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,DPAD,<button>,<state>`.

- The `state` field can have following values:  
  - **"PRESS"**: When the button is being pressed (finger on the button).  
  - **"RELEASE"**: When the button is released (finger lifted off after pressing).
  - **"CLICK"**: Indicates tap gesture
- The `button` field can be **"LEFT"**,**"RIGHT"**,**"UP"** or **"DOWN"**    

---
### **STEERING WHEEL**
Rotating a steering wheel generates this JSON:
```json
{
  "id": "your id",
  "type": "STEERING_WHEEL",
  "angle": 45.233445
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections the `CSV` is `<id>,STEERING_WHEEL,<angle>`

 - where `angle` is rotation angle of the steering wheel in degrees
   - **Positive values** indicate clockwise rotation
   - **Negative values** indicate counter-clockwise (anti-clockwise) rotation 

   

---

### **JoyStick**  
Moving joystick handle generates this JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "JOYSTICK",
  "x": 0.71150637,
  "y": -0.13367589
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** : `<id>,JOYSTICK,<x>,<y>`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd3b1b14-d1c5-42d5-8813-f01745856191" width="150" height="150">

_Note : Joystick is not rotatable in the Builder Screen_

The values of x and y range:
 - From -1.0 to 1.0 for both axes.
 - Positive x values indicate movement to the right, and negative values indicate movement to the left.
 - Positive y values indicate upward movement, and negative values indicate downward movement.    

### **Slider**  
Dragging the slider thumb generates the following JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "SLIDER",
  "value": 1.4
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, dragging the slider thumb generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,SLIDER,<value>`.

- The `value` field represents the current position of the slider.  
- The value is always within the range of the minimum and maximum values specified during the slider's configuration.

## Sending JSON Messages to DroidPad

You can send JSON messages to DroidPad to update the UI. Currently, only **SWITCH** and **SLIDER** can be updated. All connection types are supported except for **BLE**.

To update a **SWITCH** or a **SLIDER**, send a JSON object message similar to the ones specified in the [SWITCH](#switch) and [SLIDER](#slider) sections, with the desired value or state.

For **Bluetooth Classic** and **TCP** connections, you must send each JSON message on a new line. This is because DroidPad reads the incoming stream line by line. Each JSON message should be on a single line, and multiple messages should be separated by a line feed (`\n`).

For example:

```
{"id":"s1","type":"SLIDER","value":1.4}\n{"id":"s1","type":"SLIDER","value":1.5}\n{"id":"s1","type":"SLIDER","value":1.4}
```

For **MQTT**, **WebSocket**, and **UDP** connections, you can send formatted JSON without the one-line and line feed restrictions, as these are message-based protocols.


## Important Note for Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy  
A long Bluetooth device name can cause advertisement failure (In case of BLE). To avoid this issue, use a shorter name. In your device's Bluetooth settings, change the Bluetooth device name to five or fewer characters, such as `dev`.

For devices running **Android 12 or higher**, you also need to ensure that your app has the necessary Bluetooth permissions. To do this, go to the app's system settings and grant the required **Nearby Devices** permission. Without this permission, the app won't be able to advertise Bluetooth LE services or access paired devices when using Bluetooth Classic.

## Testing the connection
You can test the connections with Websocket,TCP, UDP servers and BLE client provided in [https://github.com/umer0586/droidpad-python-examples](https://github.com/umer0586/droidpad-python-examples)
