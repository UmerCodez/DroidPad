Create custom control interfaces easily with a simple drag-and-drop and transform your Android device into a remote control for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), WebSocket, MQTT, Bluetooth, TCP, and UDP protocols.

<b>Key Features:</b>

1. <b>Drag-and-Drop Control Pad Creation:</b><br>
   Design your control pads by dragging and dropping components like buttons, sliders, and switches.

2. <b>Multi-Protocol Support and Flexible Connectivity:</b>
    - For <b>WebSocket, MQTT, TCP, UDP and Bluetooth</b>, the app acts as a client, connecting to servers and enabling real-time interaction through control pad components.
    - For <b>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</b>, the app acts as a <b>peripheral (GATT server)</b>, notifying interactions such as button presses, slider changes, and switch toggles via BLE notifications.

3. <b>Switch Connection Type Anytime</b>
   You can change the connection type of a control pad at any time without creating a duplicate for a different connection.

4. <b>Update UI From your Script<b/>
   You can change the state of SWITCH,SLIDER,LED and GAUGE from your script
